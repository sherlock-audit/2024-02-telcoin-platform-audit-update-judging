# StableCoin BlackListing Feature is Ineffective

## Summary
Contrary to the expected behaviour, blacklisted users can still receive, hold and send tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract has a blacklist feature that allows the address with the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` to blacklist users. Once a user is blacklisted all of the user token holdings are sent to the blacklister.

The problem here is, assuming `Bob` is blacklisted, it is expected that `Bob` should no longer be able to:
+ Recieve these tokens
+ Hold this token
+ Send this token

`Bob` is expected to be blocked from having any interaction with this token, but it is all currently allowed, no restriction stops a blacklisted address from performing any of the above-mentioned actions and more

## Impact
Supposed blacklisted users can continue carrying out illicit activities
