# Stablecoin currency can still be used by blacklisted users

## Summary
Stablecoin currency can still be used by blacklisted users

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol stablecoin intends to include blacklisting to prevent the currency from being used for illicit or nefarious activities. It has a functionality to add an address to the list of blacklisted users and transfer any amount it had in that moment while doing so. However, doesn't actually check addresses against this blacklisted list in any of the transfer functionalities of the currency.

## Impact
Stablecoin currency can still be used by blacklisted users for illicit or nefarious activities.
