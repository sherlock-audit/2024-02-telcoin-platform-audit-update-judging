# Missing Validation of External XYZ Tokens in convertFromEXYZ Function

## Summary
The `convertFromEXYZ`  function does not use the `isXYZ`  check to validate the token before performing operations.


## Vulnerability Detail
The isXYZ function is intended to validate whether a token is recognized as a valid external XYZ token. However, in the convertFromEXYZ function, there is no call to isXYZ to ensure that the origin or target tokens are indeed valid external XYZ tokens before proceeding with the conversion.

## Impact
The absence of this validation could allow unauthorized or unintended tokens to be used in the conversion process, potentially leading to incorrect accounting, loss of funds, or exploitation of the contract's logic.

## Code Snippet
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/main/telcoin-contracts/contracts/stablecoin/StablecoinHandler.sol#L166-#L182)
```javascript
function convertFromEXYZ(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss
    ) public virtual whenNotPaused nonZero(ss) onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        if (
            Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount <
            getMinLimit(ss.origin)
        ) revert InvalidMintBurnBoundry(ss.origin);

        Stablecoin(ss.origin).burnFrom(wallet, ss.oAmount);
        ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.target).safeTransferFrom(
            safe,
            ss.destination,
            ss.tAmount
        );
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check using the `isXYZ` function to validate the origin and target tokens before executing the conversion logic in the `convertFromEXYZ` function. This ensures that only approved external XYZ tokens are used in the conversion process.
