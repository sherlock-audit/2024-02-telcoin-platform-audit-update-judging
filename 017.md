# Centralized Risk With Coin Transfer in contracts/swap/AmirX.sol

## Summary
The contract has a centralized risk, which means that the contract is controlled by a single address. If the address is compromised, the contract will be compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability provided code is that the **rescueCrypto** function in the **AmirX.sol** contract allows for centralized control over the transfer of tokens or MATIC.

In lines 234 to 246, the **rescueCrypto** function allows the contract owner with the SUPPORT_ROLE to transfer ERC20 tokens or MATIC tokens. If the token being transferred is an ERC20 token (line 238), the function calls the **safeTransfer** function of the token contract to transfer the tokens to the **_msgSender()** address (line 240). However, if the token being transferred is MATIC (Polygon's native token), the function directly transfers the MATIC tokens to the **_msgSender()** address using a low-level call (line 243).

This centralized control over the transfer of tokens or MATIC tokens poses a security risk as it allows the contract owner to potentially misuse this function to transfer tokens without proper authorization or consent. This can lead to loss of funds or manipulation of token balances within the contract.

The vulnerability in the provided code is that the **rescueCrypto** function allows the contract owner with the SUPPORT_ROLE to transfer any ERC20 token or MATIC directly to any address without proper checks. This centralized risk could potentially lead to unauthorized transfers of tokens or funds.

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Deploy a malicious contract with the following code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousContract {
    receive() external payable {}
    
    function attack(address _target, address _token, uint256 _amount) public {
        (bool success, ) = _target.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Attack failed");
    }
}
```
2. Obtain the address of the deployed **MaliciousContract**.

3. Call the **rescueCrypto** function in the vulnerable contract with the address of the **MaliciousContract** as the **_token** parameter and a specific **_amount**.

4. Call the attack function in the **MaliciousContract** with the address of the vulnerable contract as the **_target** parameter, the address of the ERC20 token or MATIC as the **_token** parameter, and the same **_amount** used in step 3.

5. The **attack** function will attempt to transfer the specified **_amount** of tokens or MATIC to the vulnerable contract, bypassing any checks and potentially draining the contract of funds.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the centralized risk in the **rescueCrypto** function to transfer tokens or funds to the vulnerable contract without proper authorization.

## Impact
This can lead to loss of funds or manipulation of token balances within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This vulnerability arises from the fact that the **defiSwap** function and **rescueCrypto** function allow for centralized control over the transfer of funds. In the **defiSwap** function, the wallet address is able to execute arbitrary code when **wallet.call** is invoked, which can lead to potential exploits. Similarly, in the **rescueCrypto** function, the contract owner has the ability to transfer any ERC20 token or MATIC directly to any address, which poses a risk of misuse.

To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a more decentralized approach to fund transfers. One way to do this is by using the Withdrawal Pattern, where users can withdraw their funds directly instead of relying on centralized functions to transfer funds on their behalf.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:

Patched Code Example

```solidity
// Define a mapping to store user balances
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public userBalances;

function deposit(uint256 amount) public payable {
    userBalances[msg.sender][address(0)] += msg.value;
    if (amount > 0) {
        ERC20(MATIC).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        userBalances[msg.sender][address(MATIC)] += amount;
    }
}

function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) public {
    require(userBalances[msg.sender][token] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    if (token == address(0)) {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    } else {
        ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
    userBalances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;
}
```
In the patched code example, users can deposit funds into the contract and withdraw them using the **deposit** and **withdraw** functions. This approach decentralizes the fund transfer process and reduces the risk of centralized control over coin transfers.
