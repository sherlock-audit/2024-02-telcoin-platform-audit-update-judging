# The protocol is not compatible with some tokens like BNB, leading to loss of these tokens

## Summary
The popular [`BNB`](https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#code) token reverts when a `0 approval` is set. Since the protocol uses `0 approvals` in most of its functions, it's incompatible with this token and others with this behavior and all BNB tokens sent to the `BridgeRelay` will be lost

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is present at two different places: 
1. [`BridgeRelay.transferERCToBridge()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/21920190e0772afa18e7f856a036fea3ef5b9635/telcoin-contracts/contracts/bridge/BridgeRelay.sol#L69) 
2. [`AmirX._buyBack`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/21920190e0772afa18e7f856a036fea3ef5b9635/telcoin-contracts/contracts/swap/AmirX.sol#L168)

Some tokens revert if a non-zero approval is being overwritten by another non-zero approval. That's why `forceApprove` is used - it first removes the old approval by setting it to 0 and then sets the new approval. However, this introduces a new problem with "BNB-like" tokens because they revert when approval is set to 0.

These "BNB-like" tokens cannot be used as `feeToken` and cannot be bridged using the PoS Bridge. This is an issue because:
1. The protocol intends to use any ERC20 tokens and BNB is a very popular one.
2. The BNB token is supported by the PoS Bridge so it's logical that it should be supported by the Telcoin protocol as well.

Let's have a look at how `BridgeRelay.bridgeTransfer()` works. 

It approves the predicate to spend the needed amount of tokens and calls the bridge. So in order for it to work, the user calling it has to had already sent their tokens to the `BridgeRelay` contract.

A user that sends their BNB tokens to this contract expecting them to be bridged will lose all of them because the bridging will always revert and the only recovery mechanism in the contract recovers only `MATIC` tokens.

```solidity
        token.forceApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, 0);
        // increase approval to necessary amount
        token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            PREDICATE_ADDRESS,
            token.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
        //deposit
        POS_BRIDGE.depositFor(
            address(this),
            address(token),
            abi.encodePacked(token.balanceOf(address(this)))
        );
```

## Impact
1. Any BNB tokens sent to the `BridgeRelay` will be lost.
2. BNB tokens cannot be bridged.
4. BNB tokens cannot be used as `feeToken`.

## Code Snippet

#### BNB.approve() 

```solidity
             function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
		    if (_value <= 0) throw; 
                    allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
                    return true;
              }
```

#### BridgeRelay.transferERCToBridge()
```solidity
            token.forceApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, 0);
            // increase approval to necessary amount
            token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                PREDICATE_ADDRESS,
                token.balanceOf(address(this))
            );
```

#### AmirX._buyBack()
```solidity
            feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
            feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
                aggregator,
                feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
            );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A possible solution may be to create a separate function for approving and a mapping with these tokens. If the token is in the mapping, skip the `forceApprove(0)`.
