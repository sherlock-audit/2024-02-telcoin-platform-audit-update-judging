# `stablecoinSwap` gives the user the same amount of tokens, regardless of the result of the `defiSwap`

## Summary
`stablecoinSwap` gives the user the same amount of tokens, regardless of the result of the `defiSwap`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the `stablecoinSwap` in the case the user wants to swap a non-stablecoin (non-xyz) to stablecoin.
```solidity
    function stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        // checks if it will fail
        _verifyStablecoin(wallet, safe, ss, defi);

        //eXYZ ot eXYZ
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin) && isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            swapAndSend(wallet, ss);
            return;
        }

        //stablecoin swap
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin) && !isXYZ(ss.target))
            convertFromEXYZ(wallet, safe, ss);

        //defi swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        if (defi.walletData.length != 0) defiSwap(wallet, safe, defi);
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        // //stablecoin swap
        if (!isXYZ(ss.origin) && isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
            convertToEXYZ(wallet, safe, ss);
        }
    }
```
In this case, the function allows the user to get called and perform a swap. If a swap occurs and the user's origin token's balance changes, the delta of it will be used for swap, regardless of how much it is. Since the result of the swap can never be exactly expected, it could even happen that the user purposefully performs a swap for only 1 wei and get the outgoing token basically for free.

Note that absolutely no inspection of the wallet and data can guarantee any 100% sure outcome of the swap. Therefore, transferring the same amount of stablecoin, regardless of the swapped amount can and will result to serious loss of funds.

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The swapper should input the exchange rate of the two tokens upon the swap and depending on the swapped amount calculate the right amount the user should receive from the swap
