# Updating to new proxies can affect old proxies due to the same implemnatation pointed by beacon

## Summary

Beacon proxies are good for updating implementation contracts, but their storage doesn't suit Telcoin's feature of updating proxy versions itself.

Look at recommendation section for better understanding.

Old proxy versions pointing to latest implementation contracts that being used by latest proxies. Issues arise when clash happens due to the latest implemntations are build to be used by latest proxy versions and not compatable for old proxies.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/21920190e0772afa18e7f856a036fea3ef5b9635/telcoin-contracts/contracts/factories/ProxyFactory.sol#L81-L87

If proxy contract ever been updated to a new proxy, the previous versions of the proxy will still point to the latest implementation that the new proxies also point to. This will be an issue when clash happens due to the latest implemntations are build to be used by latest proxy versions and not compatable for old proxies.

Scenario

1. proxy v1 is used and imp v1 is used to deploy 10 contracts
2. Now proxy v2 is being used and points to new implemntation v2
3. After a while imp v2 is upgraded to imp v3.

Now proxies v1 still point to Imp v3 instead of using Imp v2 or even v1 itself. The issue will be critical if the storage or function collision happens in those upgraded proxies / implementations.

## Impact

Old proxy versions pointing to latest implementation contracts that being used by latest proxies. Issues arise when clash happens due to the latest implemntations are build to be used by latest proxy versions and not compatable for old proxies.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Currently, all proxies versions pointing to latest implemntations. But change the storage layout to mapping (proxy ==> implementation) to be flexible for different versions of proxies pointing to their flexibe implementations.
