# User can front-run blacklisting mechanism to retain their tokens

## Summary
A user can prevent the admin blacklisting their address and removing their tokens by front-running the tx and transferring them to another address.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a blacklisting mechanism in the protocol and when a user is blacklisted, their tokens are [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/21920190e0772afa18e7f856a036fea3ef5b9635/telcoin-contracts/contracts/stablecoin/Stablecoin.sol#L123-L125) to the caller with `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`.

```solidity
    function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
        _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
    }
```

```solidity
    function addBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, true);
@>      _onceBlacklisted(user);
        emit AddedBlacklist(user);
    }
```
I believe the issue would usually be a low, but since funds are at risk of being removed, the user has incentive to front-run the blacklisting and transfer the funds to a different location to avoid losing them, which warrants medium.
## Impact
User avoids funds being taken away by blacklisting.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
        _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));
    }
```

```solidity
    function addBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, true);
@>      _onceBlacklisted(user);
        emit AddedBlacklist(user);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider using private validators for blacklisting actions.
