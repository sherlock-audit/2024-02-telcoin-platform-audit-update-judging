# Permanent Loss of Ether Due to Unhandled msg.value in bridgeTransfer Function

## Summary
The contract's **bridgeTransfer** function contains a logic flaw that results in unintentional freezing of Ether (ETH). When an ERC20 token transfer is initiated, the function fails to account for a non-zero **msg.value**, which is the amount of Ether sent along with the transaction. This oversight means that any Ether sent with a transaction intended to bridge an ERC20 token (other than ETHER or MATIC) will be trapped within the contract with no mechanism provided to withdraw it. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Permanent Loss of Ether Due to Unhandled msg.value in bridgeTransfer Function" in the provided code is that the bridgeTransfer function accepts msg.value as payable but does not handle it properly.

In lines 44 to 59 of the code, the function **bridgeTransfer** is designed to transfer ERC20 tokens or Ether to a bridge contract. However, when transferring Ether (line 58), the function does not handle the **msg.value** correctly. This can lead to a situation where Ether sent along with the function call is not accounted for or utilized, resulting in a permanent loss of Ether.

The vulnerability in the code is that the **bridgeTransfer** function accepts **msg.value** as payable but does not handle it properly. This can lead to a permanent loss of ether if an attacker sends ether along with the transaction.

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Deploy the smart contract with the vulnerable **bridgeTransfer** function.
2. Call the **bridgeTransfer** function with a value of ether attached to the transaction.
3. Since the code does not handle the **msg.value** properly, the ether sent along with the transaction will be lost permanently.

Example PoC code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

interface IERC20Withdrawable {
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
}

contract Exploit {
    address public vulnerableContract;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = _vulnerableContract;
    }

    function exploit() public payable {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000); // Replace with the actual token address
        (bool success, ) = vulnerableContract.call{value: msg.value}(abi.encodeWithSignature("bridgeTransfer(address)", token));
        require(success, "Exploit failed");
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```
By calling the **exploit** function in the **Exploit** contract with a value of ether attached, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the **bridgeTransfer** function and cause a permanent loss of ether.

## Impact
Consequently, users may inadvertently lose funds, as the Ether remains permanently locked within the contract's balance, leading to a direct financial impact for the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code is that the **bridgeTransfer** function accepts **msg.value** but does not handle it properly. This can lead to a permanent loss of Ether if someone sends Ether along with the transaction and it is not accounted for.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the **msg.value** properly in the **bridgeTransfer** function. One way to do this is to revert the transaction if **msg.value** is greater than 0 and not expected in the function.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
44       function bridgeTransfer(IERC20 token) external payable {
45           // revert if MATIC is attempted
46           if (token == MATIC) revert MATICUnbridgeable();
47           // unwrap WETH
48           if (token == WETH) {
49               IERC20Withdrawable(address(WETH)).withdraw(
50                   WETH.balanceOf(address(this))
51               );
52               // transfer ERC20 tokens
53           } else if (token != ETHER) {
54               transferERCToBridge(token);
55               return;
56           }
57           // transfer ETHER
58           require(msg.value == 0, "Ether transfer not allowed in this function");
59           POS_BRIDGE.depositEtherFor{value: address(this).balance}(address(this));
60       }
```
In the patched code, we added a **require** statement on line 58 to check if **msg.value** is equal to 0. If it is not, the transaction will revert with an error message stating that Ether transfer is not allowed in this function. This ensures that any unexpected Ether sent along with the transaction is handled properly.
