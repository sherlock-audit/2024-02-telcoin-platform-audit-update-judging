# Unsafe use of low-level calls in AmirX::defiSwap function

## Summary
The use of `call` for sending Ether or interacting with untrusted contracts is a well-known security concern in Ethereum smart contract development. This method provides a lot of flexibility but also introduces significant risks, including reentrancy attacks and unexpected changes in contract state.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `AmirX` contract, particularly within the `defiSwap` function the code looks like this:

```solidity
function defiSwap(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) public payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        (bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);
        require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");

        _feeDispersal(safe, defi);
    }
```

In this code:
- `wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData)` is used to interact with an address stored in `wallet` using data from `defi.walletData`. This can execute arbitrary code.
- The `{value: 0}` part indicates that no Ether is being sent with the call, but the method itself can be used to send Ether by specifying a non-zero value.
- `require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");` checks if the call was successful.

## Impact
### Risks Involved with `call`

1. The `call` method can lead to reentrancy attacks if the called contract calls back into any function of the `AmirX` contract, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities, especially if state changes occur after the `call`.

2. By default, `call` forwards all available gas, potentially allowing a called contract to consume all gas provided to the function, affecting the execution of later operations.

3. Since `call` is used to execute arbitrary bytecode, if the data in `defi.walletData` is crafted maliciously or if `wallet` is a malicious contract, it can lead to unintended actions being performed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Avoid using `call` for Ether transfers. For sending Ether, prefer using `transfer` or `send` as they limit the gas sent to 2300, preventing reentrancy attacks. For Solidity 0.6.x and above, using `call` for Ether transfers is recommended but with proper reentrancy guards.
