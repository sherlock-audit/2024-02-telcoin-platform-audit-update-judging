# Restriction on bridging polygon tokens not fully effective

## Summary

Polygon `MATIC` has been upgraded to a new address. The codebase puts a restriction on bridging `MATIC` tokens but uses the old `MATIC` address to check for these tokens to prevent bridge transfer. The new address can be used to potentially bypass the bridge check.

## Vulnerability Detail
From the [readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/main/telcoin-contracts/contracts/bridge/README.md) and description of the BridgeRelay contract, one of the key features is the prevention of direct `MATIC` bridging through explicit checks.

And to enforce this, the `bridgeTransfer` contains the check.

```solidity
    function bridgeTransfer(IERC20 token) external payable {
        // revert if MATIC is attempted
        if (token == MATIC) revert MATICUnbridgeable();
...
    }
```

And from the declared addresses, the declared `MATIC` address is the [old](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0) address

```solidity
    IERC20 public constant MATIC =
        IERC20(0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0);
```

This is because `MATIC` has been [upgraded](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0) and migrated to a new [address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x455e53CBB86018Ac2B8092FdCd39d8444aFFC3F6), according to their [announcement](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics). 

Since the restriction is placed on the old address, the new address will still bypass it making it less effective .

## Impact
Bridging `MATIC` tokens against the protocol's restrictions.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
Include a check for the new token in the `bridgeTransfer` function.
