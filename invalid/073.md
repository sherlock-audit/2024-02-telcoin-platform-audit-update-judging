# Owner can steal user funds

## Summary
The vulnerability lies in the ability of an owner to add a user to the blacklist and potentially seize their funds. This could lead to a loss of trust in the protocol among users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addBlackList` function allows an owner, with the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`, to add a user to the blacklist without any checks for user consent or safeguards against unauthorized actions.
then the `_onceBlacklisted` function send the user funds to the owner, with the `BLACKLISTER_ROLE`.

## Impact
Users may lose trust in the protocol due to the risk of having their funds seized without proper justification or recourse.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function addBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, true);
        _onceBlacklisted(user);
        emit AddedBlacklist(user);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a refund mechanism to compensate users if they are removed from the blacklist. Additionally, introduce checks and balances to ensure that blacklisting actions are justified and transparent, and provide users with the ability to dispute unjust blacklisting.
