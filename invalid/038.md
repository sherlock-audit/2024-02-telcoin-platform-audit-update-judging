# There's no way for a swap to use both pre-owned funds and ones received from the `defiSwap`

## Summary
There's no way for a swap to use both pre-owned funds and ones received from the `defiSwap`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the code of `stablecoinSwap` 
```solidity
    function stablecoinSwap(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        StablecoinSwap memory ss,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) external payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        // checks if it will fail
        _verifyStablecoin(wallet, safe, ss, defi);

        //eXYZ ot eXYZ
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin) && isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            swapAndSend(wallet, ss);
            return;
        }

        //stablecoin swap
        if (isXYZ(ss.origin) && !isXYZ(ss.target))
            convertFromEXYZ(wallet, safe, ss);

        //defi swap
        uint256 iBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        if (defi.walletData.length != 0) defiSwap(wallet, safe, defi);
        uint256 fBalance = ERC20(ss.origin).balanceOf(wallet);
        // //stablecoin swap
        if (!isXYZ(ss.origin) && isXYZ(ss.target)) {
            if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - iBalance;
            convertToEXYZ(wallet, safe, ss);
        }
    }
```
In the case where there's walletData included, it performs a swap and if there's difference in the balances after the swap, it uses that delta for the non-stablecoin to stablecoin swap.

The problem is that `ss.oAmount` is overridden by that delta, making it impossible for a user to use both pre-owned and post-`defiSwap` funds for the same trade/ `swap`
