# swapper can still execute deFi swaps even when the contract is paused

## Summary
swapper can still execute deFi swaps even when the contract is paused

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol enforces pause state procedures which the majority of the public swap functionality implements using the `whenNotPaused`, or will eventually call to this underlining function already having a `whenNotPaused`. This includes functions that perform both deFi swap and stablecoin swap. However, the `defiSwap()` which can be called directly without interacting with these functions:
```solidity
function defiSwap(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        DefiSwap memory defi
    ) public payable onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        (bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);
        require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");

        _feeDispersal(safe, defi);
    }
```
doesn't implement the `whenNotPaused` modifier which means In the case where the governance wants to stop all activity, they still can't stop this and would still be executable.

## Impact
In case where the governance wants to stop all activity, defiSwap would still be executable and can't be paused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier like so:

```diff
function defiSwap(
        address wallet,
        address safe,
        DefiSwap memory defi
-   ) public payable  onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
+   ) public payable whenNotPaused onlyRole(SWAPPER_ROLE) {
        (bool walletResult, ) = wallet.call{value: 0}(defi.walletData);
        require(walletResult, "AmirX: wallet transaction failed");

        _feeDispersal(safe, defi);
    }
```
