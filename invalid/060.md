# `_disableInitializers()` is not called in constructor of `AmirX.sol`

## Summary

No call to `_disableInitializers()` is made in the constructor of the `AmirX.sol` potentially exposing the tokens to unknown access.

## Vulnerability Detail

Openzeppelin recommend to call `_disableInitializers()` when there is `initialize(...)` method that is doing some state changes. This is to prevent the implementation contract from being initialized by anybody. But this is not done in the `AmirX.sol`. That means anyone can initialize the contract now which will give access of the contract to the attacker.

## Impact

Can give access to unknown user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add the `disableInitializer()` in the constructor.

```diff
File: AmirX.sol

+    constructor() public {
+        disableInitializers();
+    }
```
