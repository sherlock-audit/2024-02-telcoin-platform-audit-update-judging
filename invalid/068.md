# [M-01] Use safeTransfer() instead of _transfer

## Summary
transfer() might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring the return value leads to considering it successful.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. Checking the return value is a requirement, as written in the EIP-20 specification:

   ````Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!````

## Impact
Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
use safeTransfer() or check the return value if length of returned data is > 0.
