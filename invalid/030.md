# Front Run of the function addBlackList Medium

## Summary
The `addBlackList` function can be frontrunned.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can monitor incoming transactions and if he sees that his address is being blacklisted, he can simply withdraw all tokens before the unwanted event occurs.

## Impact
Medium. `BLACKLISTER_ROLE` will not be able to take money from a user added to the blacklist.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
