# Lack of Zero Amount Check in `Stablecoin::erc20Rescue`function, leads the loss of user funds.

## Summary
The function `erc20Rescue` in the `Stablecoin` contract does not check for a zero amount before transferring tokens to the destination address. Even though `erc20Rescue` function can be only call by the SUPPORT_ROLE but cause of the mistake or confusion the trusted role can transfer 0 amount to destination address. Which will leads to the loss of user funds. So that's why it is important to explicitly restrict the transfer of 0 amount. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `erc20Rescue` function in the `Stablecoin` contract allows only SUPPORT_ROLE to transfer tokens that are accidentally sent to the contract back to a specified destination address. But, it does not include a check to ensure that the amount being transferred is greater than zero. As a result, if a user attempts to rescue amount 0 , then the SUPPORT_ROLE will call the `erc20Rescue` function to transfer 0 amount which doesn't make any sense. or the SUPPORT_ROLE can send the 0 amount to the genuine destination address which will leads to the loss of funds for user. 

## Impact
If a user accidentally sends tokens to the `Stablecoin` contract and by mistake user attempts to rescue 0 amount or SUPPORT_ROLE pass 0 amount by mistake to `erc20Rescue` function, then destination contract will receive 0 tokens instead of the intended amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommended mitigation is to ensure that the `erc20Rescue` function checks that the amount being transferred is greater than zero before executing the transfer.

Mitigation:=

```diff
 function erc20Rescue(ERC20PermitUpgradeable token, address destination, uint256 amount)
        external
        onlyRole(SUPPORT_ROLE)
    {
+       require(amount > 0, "Stablecoin: amount should be greater than 0");
        token.safeTransfer(destination, amount);
    }
```
