# Metamorphic Contract Attack Vulnerability in Deterministic Proxy Deployment

## Summary
The create function in the provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Metamorphic Contract Attack due to its use of deterministic deployment without proper safeguards to prevent the reuse of salts or verify the integrity of the implementation contract. An attacker could exploit this by deploying a contract with a self-destruct mechanism, using it as an implementation contract, and later replacing it with a malicious implementation after self-destruction.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Metamorphic Contract Attack Vulnerability in Deterministic Proxy Deployment" in the provided code is that the clone address generated in the create function is not verified to ensure that it is a valid proxy contract before calling the initialize function on it. This vulnerability allows an attacker to deploy a malicious contract that pretends to be a proxy contract and execute arbitrary code in the initialize function.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the create function where a deterministic proxy deployment is being used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to deploy a malicious contract that can change its code after deployment, making it difficult to detect and mitigate.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can deploy a contract that initially behaves as expected but later changes its behavior to perform malicious actions. The attacker can achieve this by deploying a contract that contains code to modify its own bytecode after deployment.

Here is a simplified Proof of Concept (PoC) code to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited:

```solidity
// Malicious contract that changes its code after deployment
contract MaliciousContract {
    bool public isInitialized;
    
    function initialize() external {
        require(!isInitialized, "Already initialized");
        isInitialized = true;
    }
    
    function maliciousAction() external {
        // Perform malicious action here
    }
    
    function changeCode() external {
        // Change the contract code here
    }
}

// Attacker contract to exploit the vulnerability
contract Attacker {
    address public target;
    
    function attack(address _factory) external {
        bytes32 salt = bytes32(0);
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("initialize()");
        
        (bool success, ) = _factory.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("create(bytes32[], bytes[])", new bytes32[](1), new bytes[](1)));
        require(success, "Attack failed");
        
        target = // address of the deployed malicious contract
        
        // Call initialize function of the malicious contract
        (success, ) = target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("initialize()"));
        require(success, "Initialization failed");
        
        // Call malicious action
        (success, ) = target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("maliciousAction()"));
        require(success, "Malicious action failed");
        
        // Change the code of the malicious contract
        (success, ) = target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("changeCode()"));
        require(success, "Code change failed");
    }
}
```
In this PoC, the attacker deploys a malicious contract that initially behaves as expected by calling the initialize function. However, after deployment, the contract can change its code using the changeCode function to perform malicious actions. The attacker then uses the Attacker contract to exploit the vulnerability and call the malicious actions on the deployed contract.

This demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the Metamorphic Contract Attack Vulnerability in Deterministic Proxy Deployment to deploy a contract that can change its code after deployment to perform malicious actions.

## Impact
This could lead to the same deterministic address being used for the deployment of a contract with altered, potentially harmful logic, enabling the attacker to manipulate contract behavior, which could result in theft, freezing of assets, or other severe security breaches.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the clone address is generated deterministically based on the salts[i] value. An attacker could potentially deploy a contract with the same salts[i] value before the legitimate deployment, causing the legitimate deployment to interact with the attacker's contract instead.

To fix this issue, we can introduce a check to ensure that the clone address has not already been deployed before initializing it. One way to do this is by maintaining a mapping of deployed clones and checking against it before initializing a new clone.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched:

```solidity
// Define a mapping to keep track of deployed clones
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public deployedClones;

function create(
    bytes32[] memory salts,
    bytes[] memory data
) external onlyRole(DEPLOYER_ROLE) {
    require(
        salts.length == data.length,
        "ProxyFactory: array length mismatch"
    );

    for (uint256 i; i < salts.length; i++) {
        address clone = Clones.cloneDeterministic(proxy(), salts[i]);

        // Check if the clone has already been deployed
        require(!deployedClones[salts[i]], "ProxyFactory: clone already deployed");
        
        ClonableBeaconProxy(payable(clone)).initialize(
            address(this),
            data[i]
        );
        
        // Mark the clone as deployed
        deployedClones[salts[i]] = true;

        emit Deployed(clone, salts[i]);
    }
}
```
By adding the check **require(!deployedClones[salts[i]], "ProxyFactory: clone already deployed");** before initializing a new clone, we ensure that the same **salts[i]** value cannot be used to deploy multiple clones. This helps prevent the Metamorphic Contract Attack Vulnerability in Deterministic Proxy Deployment.
