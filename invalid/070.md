# Doesn't check if both target and origin token to be swap are the same causing inaccurate minting of the stablecoin

## Summary
Doesn't check if both target and origin token to be swap are the same causing inaccurate minting of the stablecoin

## Vulnerability Detail
The convertToEXYZ function transfers the asset to be convert and then mint the equivalent stablecoin
```solidity
ERC20PermitUpgradeable(ss.origin).safeTransferFrom(
            wallet,
            safe,
            ss.oAmount
        );
        Stablecoin(ss.target).mintTo(ss.destination, ss.tAmount);
```
However, if the target and origin token to be swap are the same it will cause more unmatched minting of the same stablecoin to be in circulation

## Impact
Inaccurate minting and inflation of the stablecoin

## Recommendation
Check that target and origin token provided should never be the same.
