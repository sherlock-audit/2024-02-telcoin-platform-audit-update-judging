# Protocol will behave unexpectedly if ss.origin is also the fee token

## Summary
Protocol will behave unexpectedly if ss.origin is also the fee token

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol will behave unexpectedly if ss.origin specified in the `stablecoinSwap()` is also the fee token, this is because of the operation below
```solidity
 if (fBalance - iBalance != 0) ss.oAmount = fBalance - Balance;
 ```
 When the `defiSwap` gets called in the function, it eventually calls `_feeDispersal()` which inturn calls `_buyBack` to swap the feeToken to TELCOIN, this means the contract balance of the fee token gets reduced if it does has a balance amount > 0. There meaning that in the case where the balance of the feetoken is > 0, the `fBalance - Balance` will underflow and revert. While some other transaction similar swap might pass depending on the contract balance of the fee token and when the time it was executed.
 
## Impact
Protocol will behave unexpectedly if ss.origin is also the fee token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Completely prevent ss.origin from being the fee token. You should do this in the `_verifyStablecoin()` function
