# Swap Path Manipulation in _buyBack Function Leads to Incorrect lastBuyBackPrice Calculation

## Summary
The **_buyBack** function exhibits a high-risk vulnerability due to its reliance on unvalidated **swapData** for calculating **lastBuyBackPrice**, which could be manipulated by an attacker. This vulnerability arises from the function's failure to account for intermediary tokens or different token sorting orders in the **swappath** parameter when performing swaps via an aggregator. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Swap Path Manipulation in **_buyBack** Function Leads to Incorrect **lastBuyBackPrice** Calculation" in the provided code is that the function **_buyBack** allows for manipulation of the swap path in the **swapData** parameter. This manipulation can lead to incorrect calculations of the **lastBuyBackPrice**.

Specifically, on line 174, the function calls the aggregator contract with the provided swapData parameter to execute a swap. However, the **swapData** parameter is not validated or sanitized in any way, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate the swap path to their advantage.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the **_buyBack** function allows for manipulation of the swap path in the **swapData** parameter, which can lead to incorrect calculation of the **lastBuyBackPrice**.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can craft a malicious **swapData** parameter that includes a different swap path than intended. By manipulating the swap path, the attacker can trick the contract into thinking that a swap was successful at a different price than what actually occurred. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the **lastBuyBackPrice**, potentially resulting in financial losses for the contract owner or users.

Proof of Concept (PoC) :

1. Craft a malicious swapData parameter with a manipulated swap path.
2. Call the _buyBack function with the malicious **swapData** parameter.
3. Observe the incorrect calculation of the **lastBuyBackPrice** due to the manipulated swap path.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can deceive the contract into making incorrect calculations based on manipulated swap paths, potentially leading to financial losses for the contract owner or users.

## Impact
 If exploited, this could lead to incorrect rebase operations and misrepresentation of **effectiveYetiTokenBalance**, potentially resulting in a contract's inability to deliver promised returns without direct loss of value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code is that the **swapData** parameter is directly passed to the aggregator contract without proper validation or manipulation. This can lead to potential manipulation of the swap path, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the **lastBuyBackPrice**.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the **swapData** parameter is properly validated and sanitized before being used in the swap transaction. One way to do this is by implementing a whitelist of allowed swap paths or using a predefined list of approved swap paths.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:

```solidity
157       function _buyBack(
158           ERC20 feeToken,
159           address aggregator,
160           bytes memory swapData
161       ) internal {
162           if (address(feeToken) == address(0)) return;
163           if (address(feeToken) == MATIC) {
164               (bool maticSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: msg.value}(swapData);
165               require(maticSwap, "AmirX: MATIC swap transaction failed");
166           } else {
167               // zero out approval
168               feeToken.forceApprove(aggregator, 0);
169               feeToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(
170                   aggregator,
171                   feeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
172               );
173   
174               // Validate and sanitize swap path
175               require(_isValidSwapPath(swapData), "AmirX: Invalid swap path");
176   
177               (bool ercSwap, ) = aggregator.call{value: 0}(swapData);
178               require(ercSwap, "AmirX: token swap transaction failed");
179           }
180       }

181       function _isValidSwapPath(bytes memory swapData) internal returns (bool) {
182           // Implement logic to validate and sanitize swap path
183           // Return true if swap path is valid, false otherwise
184           return true;
185       }
```
In the patched code, a new function **_isValidSwapPath** is introduced to validate and sanitize the swap path before executing the swap transaction. This function should contain the necessary logic to ensure that only approved swap paths are allowed to be used. By implementing this additional check, we can prevent swap path manipulation and mitigate the vulnerability in the **_buyBack** function.
