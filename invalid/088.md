# Protocol forces initiator of the swap to take in slippage without chance of reverting

## Summary
Protocol forces initiator of the swap to take in slippage with chance of reverting

## Vulnerability Detail
The agreed upon oAmount gets overridden in some case without check if the new amount exceeds the initial agreed amount. One could argue that the initiator will only approve to the agreed amount but often people approve to the max to avoid it.

## Impact
 Initiator could be forced to transfer more than what was agreed on

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this check before overriding the oAmount to prevent initiator from transferring more than what was agreed on
```solidity
oAmount >= fBalance - Balance
```
