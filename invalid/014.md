# ClonableBeaconProxy.sol contains no way to recover stuck Ether

## Summary
ClonableBeaconProxy.sol contains no way to recover stuck Ether

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a `receive()` function in `ClonableBeaconProxy.sol` that makes the contract capable of receiving ether, but there is no function to withdraw that ether, which makes the funds stuck in the contract and no way to recover them.

## Impact
Ether can get stuck
