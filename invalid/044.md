# Blacklist users cannot get their tokens back when they are removed from blacklist.

## Summary
When a user is added to the blacklist, his token is transferred to the BLACKLISTER_ROLE, but when the user is later removed from the blacklist, his token is not returned. This may lead to a loss of tokens for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
While adding user to blacklist by `addBlackList`, callback function `_onceBlacklisted` get called.
```solidity
    function addBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (blacklisted(user)) revert AlreadyBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, true);
        _onceBlacklisted(user);  // @audit
        emit AddedBlacklist(user);
    }
```

In the `_onceBlacklisted` callback, the blacklist user's tokens are totally transfered to the message sender that issues the transaction.
```solidity
    function _onceBlacklisted(address user) internal override {
        _transfer(user, _msgSender(), balanceOf(user));   // @audit
    }
```

`Blacklist` contract allows to remove a user from blacklist by `removeBlackList`, however the users' tokens are not returned. This lead to a loss of tokens for the user.
```solidity
    function removeBlackList(
        address user
    ) public virtual onlyRole(BLACKLISTER_ROLE) {
        if (!blacklisted(user)) revert NotBlacklisted(user);
        _setBlacklist(user, false);
        emit RemovedBlacklist(user);
    }
```

## Impact
When a user is removed from the blacklist, his tokens are not returned back, leading to a loss of tokens for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a mapping to track the number of tokens the user has transferred to BLACKLISTER_ROLE when he is added to blacklist, and return them when the user are removed from the blacklist.
