# Only `MATIC` can be rescued from Bridge Relay leaving some tokens stuck

## Summary
The Bridge Relay contract has a token [rescue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/main/telcoin-contracts/contracts/bridge/BridgeRelay.sol#L88-L96) function, but it works only for `MATIC` while the contract is expected to receive all types of `ERC-20` tokens according to contest `README`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract can receive all kinds of `ERC-20` tokens according to the contest `README`. The issue is that we are not transferring in the token and then attempting to make a bridge in the same function flow, which would revert the token transfer if the bridge fails. Instead, tokens are first supposed to be transferred in, then an attempt to bridge them is made.

```solidity
    function bridgeTransfer(IERC20 token) external payable {
        // revert if MATIC is attempted
        if (token == MATIC) revert MATICUnbridgeable();
        // unwrap WETH
        if (token == WETH) {
            IERC20Withdrawable(address(WETH)).withdraw(
                WETH.balanceOf(address(this))
            );
            // transfer ERC20 tokens
        } else if (token != ETHER) {
            transferERCToBridge(token);
            return;
        }
        // transfer ETHER
        POS_BRIDGE.depositEtherFor{value: address(this).balance}(address(this));
    }
```

If for whatever reason a non ETHER token is not able to be bridged (another issue I have reported shows exactly that) using the `POS_BRIDGE`, it will be stuck in the contract for an indefinite amount of time until the bridge supports transfers of that token.

The `erc20Rescue` function only rescues stuck `MATIC`:

```solidity
    function erc20Rescue(address destination) external {
        // restrict to woner
        require(
            msg.sender == OWNER_ADDRESS,
            "BridgeRelay: caller must be owner"
        );
        //transfer MATIC
        MATIC.safeTransfer(destination, MATIC.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
## Impact
Tokens will be stuck in the contract indefinitely.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function erc20Rescue(address destination) external {
        // restrict to woner
        require(
            msg.sender == OWNER_ADDRESS,
            "BridgeRelay: caller must be owner"
        );
        //transfer MATIC
        MATIC.safeTransfer(destination, MATIC.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

## Recommendation
```diff
-   function erc20Rescue(address destination) external {
+   function erc20Rescue(address destination, IERC20 token) external {
        // restrict to woner
        require(
            msg.sender == OWNER_ADDRESS,
            "BridgeRelay: caller must be owner"
        );
        //transfer MATIC
-       MATIC.safeTransfer(destination, MATIC.balanceOf(address(this)));
+       token.safeTransfer(destination, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
