# Front Run of addBlackList() function

## Summary
Front Run of addBlackList() function

## Vulnerability Detail
Front running can be done either by sending a tx with a higher gas price (usually tx are ordered in a block by the gas price / total fee), or by paying an additional fee to the validator if they manage to run their tx without reverting

## Impact
Malicious user could listen the mempool in order to check if he sees a tx of blacklisting for his address , if it happens he could front run this tx by sending a tx with higher gas fee to transfer his funds to another address to prevent them to be removed by _onceBlacklisted() function
