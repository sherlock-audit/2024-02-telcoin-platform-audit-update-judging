# Protocol will not work on Polygon blockchains due to hardcoded WETH contract address.

## Summary
Protocol will not work on Polygon blockchains due to hardcoded WETH contract address.
## Vulnerability Detail
as mention 

> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> Ethereum and Polygon

WETH address is hardcoded this mean the protocol will not work on polygon cuz the WETH is different on polygon 

WETH on polygon `0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619`
## Impact
Protocol will not work on Polygon blockchains.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    IERC20 public constant WETH = IERC20(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The WETH variable should be immutable in the contract instead of a constant
