# Bridged tokens cannot be handled on the child chain

## Summary
The tokens or Ether bridged to Polygon POS chain are lost due to the lack of the handling because the bridge to `user` address on polygon is same as mainnet bridge relay contract which cant transfer tokens or some EOA which can be owned by someone.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function transferERCToBridge(IERC20 token) internal {
        //zero out approvals
        token.forceApprove(PREDICATE_ADDRESS, 0); 
        // increase approval to necessary amount
        token.safeIncreaseAllowance(
            PREDICATE_ADDRESS,
            token.balanceOf(address(this))
        );

        POS_BRIDGE.depositFor(
>>>         address(this), 
            address(token),
            abi.encodePacked(token.balanceOf(address(this)))
        );
    }
```

Using Bridge relay contract, anyone can call [transferERCToBridge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-telcoin-platform-audit-update/blob/21920190e0772afa18e7f856a036fea3ef5b9635/telcoin-contracts/contracts/bridge/BridgeRelay.sol#L67-L81) and the balance of the contract will be bridged and transfered to the same contract address on Polygon, because the `user` param is using `address(this)` as shown above.
So, to handle the bridged tokens on child chain (polygon), the `user` address should either be a contract / EOA / safe wallet, 

Team says that [discord proof](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1215120384974917652/1215284432148365373) `interacting with the bridge and transfering tokens is essentially the soul purpse of the contract. The reason we use address(this) is because the tokens have been deposited on that address on the mainnet and we need them at that same address on polygon`

So, contract ahs to be same address on both chains, but Bridge relay contract lacks token transfer actions.

Now look at the below possiblilities
1. Deploying this Bridge relay on both chains by same owner with same nonce can yield same contract address, but Bridge relay contract lacks token handling - no tokens can be transfered out.
2. The possiblities of that address being EOA is high, but no one can know the private key.
3. The address being a safe wallet is low probability and the Telcoin team being owners is not possible.

So, the main issue is, the tokens bridged are lost forever. Look at the recommendation section

## Impact
The tokens bridged from Ethereum to Polygon cannot be transferred or handled by user/owner.

Modify `BridgeRelay` contract to handle transferring tokens with access control
