# Function in StablecoinHandler may revert on underflow and malfunction the contract

## Summary

Some functions in both StablecoinHandler and the children contract implemented can revert on underflow. 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

An underflow condition can disrupt normal contract operations, leading to unexpected reverts that mask the intended error messages. Specifically, calculations that subtract `ss.oAmount` from `Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply()` without prior validation can fail silently if totalSupply is less than ss.oAmount, resulting in a generic underflow error rather than a more descriptive and anticipated revert. This not only makes debugging difficult but also obscures the logic's intent, potentially complicating error handling and interaction patterns with the contract.

```solidity
   if (Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin)) revert InvalidMintBurnBoundry(ss.origin);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue and enhance error transparency, it is recommended to first validate that the total supply is greater than the amount to be subtracted. This approach ensures that the operation can only proceed if it will not result in an underflow, thereby preserving the intended logic flow and making errors more understandable: 

```solidity
 if (Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() > ss.oAmount) {
            if (Stablecoin(ss.origin).totalSupply() - ss.oAmount < getMinLimit(ss.origin)) revert InvalidMintBurnBoundry(ss.origin);
        }
```

This preventive measure not only avoids underflow but also clarifies the contract's behavior, making it more predictable and easier to interact with safely.
