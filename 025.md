# In `BridgeRelay` contract the user MATIC balance can lost permanently.

## Summary
The contract `BridgeRelay` allows for the transfer of MATIC tokens to a destination account. However, if multiple accounts transfer MATIC tokens to this contract, all the MATIC balance will be sent to a single user address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BridgeRelay::erc20Rescue` function, which allows the contract owner to return MATIC tokens from the contract to a specified destination. Since there is no logic implemented to differentiate between different users who might have deposited MATIC tokens directly to `BridgeRelay` contract, all the MATIC tokens held by the contract will be sent to the single user address specified by the owner, regardless to the original depositors.

## Impact
The impact is that if multiple users deposit MATIC tokens to the contract, intending to bridge them to another network or perform some other operation, the entire MATIC balance will be redirected to a single address determined by the owner. This could result in loss of funds for the depositors and disrupt the intended functionality of the contract.

## Proof Of Concept
The below test case shows how an attacker can transfer matic token to `BridgeRelay` just right after the genuine user transaction and can get the whole amount of matic token available in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
The recommended mitigation can be is to add new param amount in the `erc20Rescue` function so that only specified amount of the matic token which transfer by user in `BridgeRelay` contract is return to the user not the whole matic amount of contract.
