# BURNER_ROLE can burn an arbitrary amount of tokens from any address.

## Summary
See below
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `burnFrom` function of the contract, any address with the `BURNER_ROLE` can burn tokens from any other address without sufficient restriction or validation. Here's how the vulnerability is manifested in the code:
```solidity
function burnFrom(
    address account,
    uint256 value
) public onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
    _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), value);
    _burn(account, value);
}
```
The `burnFrom` function first checks allowance by calling `_spendAllowance` to ensure that the `msg.sender` (the caller) has been approved to spend tokens on behalf of account.
Then, it proceeds to burn the specified amount of tokens from the account by calling the internal `_burn` function.
## Impact
The lack of restriction on token burning poses a risk of unauthorized burning of tokens from any address by addresses with the `BURNER_ROLE`, potentially resulting in loss of tokens and affecting the token economy's integrity.
