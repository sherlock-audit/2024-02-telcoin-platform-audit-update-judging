# No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary

Upgradeable contracts necessitate a storage gap to ensure developers can add new state variables in future updates without affecting the storage layout of previously deployed contracts. 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

In the absence of a storage gap, there's a risk that variables in the contracts could be inadvertently overwritten by those in an updated base contract, leading to potentially severe and unintended impacts on the child contracts. This precaution helps prevent such issues, ensuring the stability and reliability of contract upgrades.
