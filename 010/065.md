# `initialize` function not disabled in `AmirX` contract.

## Summary
The contract `AmirX` does not call the `_disableInitializers()` function in its constructor, which leads to  make the  contract unpaused if it is meant to be paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract `AmirX` contract does not call  `_disableInitializers()` function in its constructor. Which makes the implementation contract to call `initialize` function even after it is called by the proxy. The calling of `initialize` function again in implementation contract will make the contract unpaused if it is paused. 

## Impact
If the contract is meant to be paused the calling of `initialize` function again in implementation contract will make the contract unpaused.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call the _disableInitializers() function in the constructor of the AmirX contract to prevent the execution of initialize functions after it is called by proxy or called on implementation contract.
Recommendation in code:-
```javascript
 /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
+  constructor() {
+    _disableInitializers();
+  }
```
